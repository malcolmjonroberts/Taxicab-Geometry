    <title>Introduction To Taxicab Geometry</title>

    <section> <title> What Is Taxicab Geometry </title>
        <p>
            A standard reference on taxicab geometry for those new to the subject is <xref ref="biblio-krause-book" />. Krause begins his treatise by saying:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The usual way to describe a (plane) geometry is to tell what its <em> points </em> are, what its <em> lines </em> are, how <em> distance </em> is measured, and how <em> angle measure </em> is determined. 
                <fn>
                    Note that Krause is talking about <em> a geometry </em> here, not about geometry in general. I should pursue this but instead I am just going to blissfully skip over it.
                </fn>
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The standard geometry taught in schools is plane Euclidean geometry. Intuitively, this geometry can be thought of as the geometry of a sheet of paper (the Euclidean plane). The points, then, are the (infinitesimal) dots that make up a plane. The lines are those paths that can be drawn with a straight edge. Distances can be measured using a suitable ruler and angle measures can be determined using a protractor. I will use the symbol <m> \mathbb{R}^2 </m> to denote the Euclidean plane.
        </p>

        <p>
            Further, if a rectangular coordinate system is drawn on the sheet of paper then the points on the plane can be uniquely identified by their coordinates with respect to that coordinate system, lines can be identified via a linear equation in two variables and distances can be calculated via Pythagoras' Theorem. Angle measures can also be calculated, rather than measured via a protractor say, but not quite so simply. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I will refer to the study of the geometry of the Euclidean plane via the use of a rectangular coordinate system as <term> Euclidean coordinate geometry </term> or either just <em> Euclidean geometry </em> or <em>co-ordinate geometry</em>. (You will also see it referred to as <em> analytic geometry </em> or <em> Cartesian geometry </em>). Euclidean co-ordinate geometry, then, is the starting place for our journey into taxicab geometry.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taxicab geometry, as introduced in <xref ref="biblio-krause-book" />, is exactly the same as Euclidean coordinate geometry except in the way that distance is calculated. So, points are still the (infinitesimal) dots that make up the plane and they are still uniquely identified by their coordinates with respect to a set of rectangular axes. Lines are still those paths that can be drawn with a straight edge and angle measures can still be determined using a protractor.
        </p>
      
        <p>  
            Recall that in co-ordinate geometry the distance between the two points <m> A=(x_1,y_1) </m> and <m> B=(x_2,y_2) </m> in the plane, which we will denote by the symbol <m> d_E(A,B) </m>, is calculated via the formula
            <men xml:id="equation-euclidean-distance">
                d_E(A,B)=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}
            </men>.
            I will refer to this distance as the <term> Euclidean distance </term> between the points, (hence the subscript <m> E </m> in the symbol). 
        </p>
        <p>
            In taxicab geometry, the distance between the two points, which I will denote by <m> d_T(A,B) </m>, is now calculated via the formula
            <men xml:id="equation-taxicab-distance">
                d_T(A,B)=|x_2-x_1|+|y_2-y_1|
            </men>.
            I will refer to this distance as the <term> taxicab distance </term> <idx>taxicab distance</idx> between the points
            <fn>
                Both of these formulas are examples of what is known as a <em>metric</em>. Once again I am going to happily skip over this.
            </fn>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To get an intuitive idea of what this means look at <xref ref="figure-taxicab-path" />. This figure is a GeoGebra animation and initially just the points <m> A=(-2,1) </m> and <m> B=(2,4) </m> are shown. Now, the Euclidean distance between the two points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> would be measured along the straight line path that joins the two points. Thus,
            <me>
                d_E(A,B)=\sqrt{(2-(-2))^2+(4-1)^2}=5
            </me>.
            The taxicab distance, however, is
            <me>
                d_T(A,B)=|2-(-2)|+|4-1|=7
            </me>.
            This distance is equivalent to measuring the distance along the shortest path from <m> A </m> to <m> B </m> that always stays parallel to either the <m> x </m>-axis or the <m> y </m>-axis. Note that this path is not necessarily unique as you will see if you click the <kbd>Draw a taxicab path</kbd> button in <xref ref="figure-taxicab-path" /> several times.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="figure-taxicab-path">
            <caption>Taxicab paths between two points</caption>
            <interactive platform="geogebra" width="85%" aspect="1:1">
                <slate surface="geogebra" material="cxvr8xma" aspect="1:1">
                    setAxisSteps(2, 1, 1, 0);
                    setCoordSystem(-5, 5, -5, 5);
                </slate>
                <instructions>
                    <p>
                        You can move the points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> around but they are constrained to have integer co-ordinates.
                    </p>
                </instructions>
            </interactive>
        </figure>

        <p>
            So, if we were to imagine that the grid lines in <xref ref="figure-taxicab-path" /> were the <em> streets </em> of some city then we could think of the Euclidean distance between the points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> as the distance along the path that a crow would fly between the points and we could think of the taxicab distance as the distance along the path that the (honest) taxicab driver would drive. So I guess that it seems reasonable that this geometry came to be (affectionately) known as taxicab geometry.
        </p>

        <p>
            Already we can see a difference between Euclidean geometry and taxicab geometry. In Euclidean geometry the path that is used to determine the distance between two points is along the line joining <m> A </m> and <m> B </m>, and it is unique. In taxicab geometry the path that is used to determine the distance between two points isn't necessarily unique, as you might have seen in <xref ref="figure-taxicab-path" />. So, let's call any path between two points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> that is used to determine the taxicab distance between the points a <term> taxicab path </term>. <idx>taxicab path</idx> Further, let's call the set of all possible taxicab paths for the two points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> the <term> taxicab set </term> <idx>taxicab set</idx> for the points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m>.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Note that in <xref ref="figure-taxicab-path" /> the points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> were constrained to have integer co-ordinates and the taxicab path between the points were constrained to only go along the grid lines. This doesn't have to be the case, the points can be anywhere in the plane and taxicab paths are constrained only to always stay parallel to either the <m> x </m>-axis or the <m> y </m>-axis. I made the additional constraints in the figure simply to make the connection to taxicabs seem a little more plausible! 
        </p>

        <p>
            So in taxicab geometry then, you should be able to convince yourself that the taxicab set for two points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> will be a either a rectangle with <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> at opposite vertices or an interval joining <m> A </m> and <m> B </m>. Further, when the taxicab set is an interval the taxicab path is unique.
        </p>

        <p>
            In closing this first discussion of taxicab geometry it is worth pointing out explicitly that when discussing taxicab geometry we will often resort to using the language and the tools of (the familiar) Euclidean co-ordinate geometry. This is only natural, we will use what we know to explore what we don't know. Of course, in places it will be easy to confuse whether we are talking about taxicab geometry results or Euclidean geometry results (or maybe both). Hopefully, care with language, terminology, symbols and other details will minimise such confusion.

    <section> <title> Taxicab Circles </title>
        <p>
            To get an insight into the nature of taxicab geometry, this section introduces the idea of circles in taxicab geometry. The plan of attack is to begin by looking at how circles arise in Euclidean geometry and then to use that to guide the development of the idea in taxicab geometry. Note that this will be the plan of attack for all that we use for all of the topics that we will explore in taxicab geometry. However, as you will see, along the way we will come across places where we will have to make decisions on how to proceed with the development of some ideas in taxicab geometry. Because taxicab geometry isn't widely used there are many such places where there is no weight of evidence or thought pointing to what would be the most advantageous way to proceed. In such cases, we are free to make to whatever decision seems sensible at the time. It could be that later on we realise that our decision wasn't a good one for whatever reason. In which case we can go back, change it, (with the benifit of some insight), and see what happens. I have to say doing this turns out to be rather fun (and, dare I say it, <em> creative </em>)!
        </p>
        <p>
            The Wikipedia article on the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"> Circle </url> defines a circle as follows:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given <em> distance </em> from a given point, the centre. The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius.
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The emphasis in the above quote is mine <ellipsis /> I wanted to highlight that this definition is in terms of distance. Of course, the distance that the article is referring to is the Euclidean distance. So, let the given point, (<ie /> the centre), be <m> C=(a,b) </m> and let the given distance, (<ie /> the radius),be <m> r </m>. (So <m> a </m>, <m> b </m> and <m> r </m> are known quantities.) Then, if <m> P=(x,y) </m> is some point on the circle then using Equation <xref ref="equation-taxicab-distance" /> we have
            <me>
                \sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}=r
            </me>
            which can be rearranged to give the equation of a (Euclidean) circle with centre <m> C=(a,b) </m> and radius <m> r </m>, that is:
            <me>
                (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2
            </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Repeating this process but using taxicab distance formula instead of the Euclidean distance formula gives the equation of a <term> taxicab circle </term>, <idx>taxicab circle</idx> namely
            <me>
                |x-a|+|y-b|=r
            </me>.
            <xref ref="figure-taxicab-circle" /> uses GeoGebra to show a plot of the taxicab circle with centre with centre <m> C=(1,2) </m> and radius <m> r=2 </m>. As you can see it is somewhat different to the Euclidean circle with the same centre and radius. You should take the time to check that the points on the taxicab circle are indeed a taxicab distance of 2 away from <m> C </m> and that there are no other points that are a taxicab distance of 2 away from <m> C </m>.

        <p>
            If you were to plot the graph of the taxicab circle with centre with centre <m> C=(1,2) </m> and radius <m> r=2 </m> by hand you would have to plot the graph of the equation
            <me>
                |x-1|+|y-2|=2
            </me>.
            The graph of this equation is probably easier seen if the equation is rewritten as
            <md>
                <mrow> y\amp=5-x \amp \text{when } \amp x \ge 1, y\ge 2</mrow>
                <mrow> y\amp=x-1 \amp \text{when } \amp x \ge 1, y\lt 2</mrow>

            </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will explore properties of taxicab circles further in ???? but I can't resist talking about <m> \pi </m> now. In Euclidean geometry <m> \pi </m> is defined as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle. So, let's try to use that definition for taxicab circles. <xref ref="figure-taxicab-pi"/> shows a taxicab circle with centre <m> C </m> and radius <m> r </m>, say, as well as a straight line passing through <m> C </m>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="figure-taxicab-pi">
            <caption>A taxicab circle and a diameter</caption>
            <image width="85%" source="./workspaces/Taxicab-Geometry/assets/taxicab-pi-diagram.jpg">
                <shortdescription>
                    <p>
                        To determine <m> \pi </m> we need to determine the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of the circle.
                    </p>
                </shortdescription>
            </image>
        </figure>

        <p>
            To determine the circumference of the circle we need to first determine the length of one of the <q>sides</q> of the circle, for example the interval <m> DE </m>. Now, we can use the taxicab distance formula <xref ref="equation-taxicab-distance" /> to determine the taxicab distance between the points <m> D </m> and <m> E </m> but we have the problem that the path used to determine this distance doesn't coincide with the side <m> DE </m>. For the moment then, let's make the following decision.
            <fn>
                We will look at the idea of the length of an interval in more detail in ????
            </fn>
        </p>

        <definition xml:id="definition-interval-length">
            <idx>length of an interval</idx>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    The length of the interval joining the points <m> D </m> and <m> E </m> is given by the taxicab distance between the endpoints of the interval, <ie /> <m> D </m> and <m> E </m>.
              </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>
            With this definition, we can now determine that the length of <q>side</q> <m> DE </m> is <m> 2r </m>. This is because the taxicab distance between <m> D </m> and <m> E </m> is <m> 2r </m>, (which you can see by using the taxicab path <m> DC </m>, <m> CE </m>). Since the taxicab circle consists of four <q> sides </q> the circumference of the circle is
            <me>
                \text{circumference}=4*(2r)=8r
            </me>.
            Similarly the diameter of the circle will be the length of the interval <m> AB </m> which is, using <xref ref="definition-interval-length" />, <m> 2r </m>. Thus, so long as we are happy with <xref ref="definition-interval-length" />, we have:

    <section> <title> Taxicab Angles </title>
        <p>
            As mentioned earlier, the taxicab geometry considered by Kraus was the same as Euclidean co-ordinate geometry except for the way that distance is calculated. However the taxicab geometry that I am going to explore has one other distinction from Euclidean co-ordinate geometry, the way that angles are determined. As we have done already, we will be guided by ideas from Euclidean geometry.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Euclidean geometry, the radian is an often used measure of an angle. We can define one radian, (denoted by <m> 1^c </m>), as the measure of the angle subtended at the centre of the unit circle by an arc of the circle of length 1. See figure ????. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course the unit circle used in defining the radian is the Euclidean circle. So, let's define the taxicab radian, which I will call the tradian, in a similar fashion but using the taxicab circle.
        </p>

        <definition xml:id="definition-tradian">
            <idx>tradian</idx>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    One <term> tradian </term>, (denoted by <m> 1^t </m>), is defined to be the taxicab measure of the angle subtended at the centre of the unit taxicab circle by an arc of the circle of length 1.
