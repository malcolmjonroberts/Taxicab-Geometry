  <section> <title> What Is Taxicab Geometry </title>
    <p>
      A standard reference on taxicab geometry for those new to the subject is <xref ref="biblio-krause-book" />. Krause begins his treatise by saying:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The usual way to describe a (plane) geometry is to tell what its <em> points </em> are, what its <em> lines </em> are, how <em> distance </em> is measured, and how <em> angle measure </em> is determined. 
        <fn>
          Note that Krause is talking about <em> a geometry </em> here, not about geometry in general. I should pursue this but instead I am just going to blissfully skip over it.
        </fn>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The standard geometry taught in schools is plane Euclidean geometry. Intuitively, this geometry can be thought of as the geometry of a sheet of paper (the Euclidean plane). The points, then, are the (infinitesimal) dots that make up a plane. The lines are those paths that can be drawn with a ruler. Distances can be measured using a suitable ruler and angle measures can be determined using a protractor. We will use the symbol <m> \mathbb{R}^2 
      </m> to denote the Euclidean plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further, if a rectangular coordinate system is drawn on the sheet of paper then the points on the plane can be uniquely identified by their coordinates with respect to this coordinate system, lines can be identified via a linear equation in two variables and distances can be calculated via Pythagoras' Theorem. Angle measures can also be calculated, rather than measured via a protractor say, but not quite so simply. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We will refer to the study of the geometry of the Euclidean plane via the use of a rectangular coordinate system as <term> coordinate geometry </term> (but it is also known as <term> analytic geometry </term> or <term> Cartesian geometry </term>). Co-ordinate geometry, then, is the starting place for our journey into taxicab geometry.
    </p>

      Taxicab geometry, as introduced in <xref ref="biblio-krause-book" />, is exactly the same as coordinate geometry except in the way that distance is calculated. In Euclidean geometry the distance between the two points <m> A=(x_1,y_1) </m> and <m> B=(x_2,y_2) </m> in the plane, which we will denote by <m> d_E(A,B) </m>, is calculated via the formula
      <me>
        d_E(A,B)=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^}
      </me>.
      In taxicab geometry, the distance between the two points, which we will denote by <m> d_T(A,B) </m>, is calculated via the formula
      <me>
        d_T(A,B)=\abs{(x_2-x_1)}+\abs{(y_2-y_1)}
      </me>.
