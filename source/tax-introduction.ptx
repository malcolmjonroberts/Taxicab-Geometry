    <title>Introduction To Taxicab Geometry</title>

    <section> <title> What Is Taxicab Geometry </title>
        <p>
            A standard reference on taxicab geometry for those new to the subject is <xref ref="biblio-krause-book" />. Krause begins his treatise by saying:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The usual way to describe a (plane) geometry is to tell what its <em> points </em> are, what its <em> lines </em> are, how <em> distance </em> is measured, and how <em> angle measure </em> is determined. 
                <fn>
                    Note that Krause is talking about <em> a geometry </em> here, not about geometry in general. I should pursue this but instead I am just going to blissfully skip over it.
                </fn>
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The standard geometry taught in schools is plane Euclidean geometry. Intuitively, this geometry can be thought of as the geometry of a sheet of paper (the Euclidean plane). The points, then, are the (infinitesimal) dots that make up a plane. The lines are those paths that can be drawn with a straight edge. Distances can be measured using a suitable ruler and angle measures can be determined using a protractor. We will use the symbol <m> \mathbb{R}^2 </m> to denote the Euclidean plane.
        </p>

        <p>
            Further, if a rectangular coordinate system is drawn on the sheet of paper then the points on the plane can be uniquely identified by their coordinates with respect to that coordinate system, lines can be identified via a linear equation in two variables and distances can be calculated via Pythagoras' Theorem. Angle measures can also be calculated, rather than measured via a protractor say, but not quite so simply. 
        </p>

        <p>
            We will refer to the study of the geometry of the Euclidean plane via the use of a rectangular coordinate system as <term> Euclidean coordinate geometry </term> or either just <em> Euclidean geometry </em> or <em>co-ordinate geometry</em>. (You will also see it referred to as <em> analytic geometry </em> or <em> Cartesian geometry </em>). Euclidean co-ordinate geometry, then, is the starting place for our journey into taxicab geometry.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taxicab geometry, as introduced in <xref ref="biblio-krause-book" />, is exactly the same as Euclidean coordinate geometry except in the way that distance is calculated. So, points are still the (infinitesimal) dots that make up the plane and they are still uniquely identified by their coordinates with respect to a set of rectangular axes. Lines are still those paths that can be drawn with a straight edge and angle measures can still be determined using a protractor.
        </p>
      
        <p>  
            Recall that in co-ordinate geometry the distance between the two points <m> A=(x_1,y_1) </m> and <m> B=(x_2,y_2) </m> in the plane, which we will denote by the symbol <m> d_E(A,B) </m>, is calculated via the formula
            <men xml:id="equation-euclidean-distance">
                d_E(A,B)=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}
            </men>.
            We will refer to this distance as the <term> Euclidean distance </term> between the points, (hence the subscript <m> E </m> in the symbol). 
        </p>
        <p>
            In taxicab geometry, the distance between the two points, which we will denote by <m> d_T(A,B) </m>, is now calculated via the formula
            <men xml:id="equation-taxicab-distance">
                d_T(A,B)=|x_2-x_1|+|y_2-y_1|
            </men>.
            We will refer to this distance as the <term> taxicab distance </term> <idx>taxicab distance</idx> between the points
            <fn>
                Both of these formulas are examples of what is known as a <em>metric</em>. Once again I am going to happily skip over this.
            </fn>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To get an intuitive idea of what this means look at <xref ref="figure-taxicab-path" />. This figure is a GeoGebra animation and initially just the points <m> A=(-2,1) </m> and <m> B=(2,4) </m> are shown. Now, the Euclidean distance between the two points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> would be measured along the straight line path that joins the two points. Thus,
            <me>
                d_E(A,B)=\sqrt{(2-(-2))^2+(4-1)^2}=5
            </me>.
            The taxicab distance, however, is
            <me>
                d_T(A,B)=|2-(-2)|+|4-1|=7
            </me>.
            This distance is equivalent to measuring the distance along the shortest path from <m> A </m> to <m> B </m> that always stays parallel to either the <m> x </m>-axis or the <m> y </m>-axis. Note that this path is not necessarily unique as you will see if you click the <kbd>Draw a taxicab path</kbd> button in <xref ref="figure-taxicab-path" /> several times.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="figure-taxicab-path">
            <caption>Taxicab paths between two points</caption>
            <interactive platform="geogebra" width="85%" aspect="1:1">
                <slate surface="geogebra" material="cxvr8xma" aspect="1:1">
                    setAxisSteps(2, 1, 1, 0);
                    setCoordSystem(-5, 5, -5, 5);
                </slate>
                <instructions>
                    <p>
                        You can move the points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> around but they are constrained to have integer co-ordinates.
                    </p>
                </instructions>
            </interactive>
        </figure>

        <p>
            So, if we were to imagine that the grid lines in <xref ref="figure-taxicab-path" /> were the <em> streets </em> of some city then we could think of the Euclidean distance between the points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> as the distance along the path that a crow would fly between the points and we could think of the taxicab distance as the distance along the path that the (honest) taxicab driver would drive. So we guess that it seems reasonable that this geometry came to be (affectionately) known as taxicab geometry.
        </p>

        <p>
            Already we can see a difference between Euclidean geometry and taxicab geometry. In Euclidean geometry the path that is used to determine the distance between two points is along the line joining <m> A </m> and <m> B </m>, and it is unique. In taxicab geometry the path that is used to determine the distance between two points isn't necessarily unique, as you might have seen in <xref ref="figure-taxicab-path" />. So, let's call any path between two points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> that is used to determine the taxicab distance between the points a <term> taxicab path </term>. <idx>taxicab path</idx> Further, let's call the set of all possible taxicab paths for the two points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> the <term> taxicab set </term> <idx>taxicab set</idx> for the points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m>.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Note that in <xref ref="figure-taxicab-path" /> the points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> were constrained to have integer co-ordinates and the taxicab path between the points were constrained to only go along the grid lines. This doesn't have to be the case, the points can be anywhere in the plane and taxicab paths are constrained only to always stay parallel to either the <m> x </m>-axis or the <m> y </m>-axis. We made the additional constraints in the figure simply to make the connection to taxicabs seem a little more plausible! 
        </p>

        <p>
            So in taxicab geometry then, you should be able to convince yourself that the taxicab set for two points <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> will be a either a rectangle with <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> at opposite vertices or an interval joining <m> A </m> and <m> B </m>. Further, when the taxicab set is an interval the taxicab path is unique.
        </p>

        <p>
            In closing our first discussion of taxicab geometry it is worth pointing out explicitly that when discussing taxicab geometry we will often resort to using the language and the tools of (our familiar) Euclidean co-ordinate geometry. This is only natural, we will use what we know to explore what we don't know. Of course, in places it will be easy to confuse whether we are talking about taxicab geometry results or Euclidean geometry results (or maybe both). Hopefully, care with language, terminology, symbols and other details will minimise such confusion.

    <section> <title> Taxicab Circles </title>
        <p>
            The Wikipedia article on the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"> Circle </url> defines the circle as follows:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given <em> distance </em> from a given point, the centre. The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius.
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The emphasis in the above quote is ours <ellipsis /> we are highlighting that this definition is in terms of distance. Of course, the distance that the article is referring to is the Euclidean distance. So, let the given point, (<ie /> the centre), be <m> C=(a,b) </m> and let the given distance, (<ie /> the radius),be <m> r </m>. Then, if <m> P=(x,y) </m> is some point on the circle then using <xref ref="equation-taxicab-distance" /> we have
            <me>
                \sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}=r
            </me>
        </p>
