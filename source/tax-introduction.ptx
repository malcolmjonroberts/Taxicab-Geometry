  <section> <title> What Is Taxicab Geometry </title>
    <p>
      A standard reference on taxicab geometry for those new to the subject is <xref ref="biblio-krause-book" />. Krause begins his treatise by saying:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The usual way to describe a (plane) geometry is to tell what its <em> points </em> are, what its <em> lines </em> are, how <em> distance </em> is measured, and how <em> angle measure </em> is determined. 
        <fn>
          Note that Krause is talking about <em> a geometry </em> here, not about geometry in general. I should pursue this but instead I am just going to blissfully skip over it.
        </fn>
      </p>

    <p>
      The standard geometry taught in schools is plane Euclidean geometry. Intuitively, this geometry can be thought of as the geometry of a sheet of paper (the Euclidean plane). The points, then, are the (infinitesimal) dots that make up a plane. The lines are those paths that can be drawn with a ruler. Distances can be measured using a suitable ruler and angle measures can be determined using a protractor. We will use the symbol <m> \mathbb{R}^2 
      </m> to denote the Euclidean plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further, if a rectangular coordinate system is drawn on the sheet of paper then the points on the plane can be uniquely identified by their coordinates with respect to this coordinate system, lines can be identified via a linear equation in two variables and distances can be calculated via Pythagoras' Theorem. Angle measures can also be calculated, rather than measured via a protractor say, but not quite so simply. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We will refer to the study of the geometry of the Euclidean plane via the use of a rectangular coordinate system as <term> coordinate geometry </term> (but it is also known as <term> analytic geometry </term> or <term> Cartesian geometry </term>). Co-ordinate geometry, then, is the starting place for our journey into taxicab geometry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taxicab geometry, as introduced in <xref ref="biblio-krause-book" />, is exactly the same as coordinate geometry except in the way that distance is calculated. So, points are still the (infinitesimal) dots that make up the plane and they are still uniquely identified by their coordinates with respect to a set of rectangular axes. Lines are still those paths that can be drawn with a ruler and angle measures can still be determined using a protractor.

      Recall that in Euclidean geometry the distance between the two points <m> A=(x_1,y_1) </m> and <m> B=(x_2,y_2) </m> in the plane, which we will denote by <m> d_E(A,B) </m>, is calculated via the formula
      <me>
        d_E(A,B)=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}
      </me>.
      In taxicab geometry, the distance between the two points, which we will denote by <m> d_T(A,B) </m>, is now calculated via the formula
      <me>
        d_T(A,B)=|x_2-x_1|+|y_2-y_1|
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get an intuitive idea of what this means imagine the points <m> A=(-2,1) </m> and <m> B=(2,4) </m> plotted on the plane, as shown in figure ? Then the Euclidean distance between the two points is measured along the straight line path that joins the two points, <ie /> along the path that a crow would fly between the points. Thus
      <me>
        d_E(A,B)=\sqrt{(2-(-2))^2+(4-1)^2}=5
      </me>.
      The taxicab distance, however, is measured along the shortest path that always stays parallel to either the <m> x</m>-axis or the <m> y </m>-axis, <ie /> along the path that the (honest) taxicab driver would drive, given that the grid lines on the plane correspond to <em> streets </em>. Thus
      <me>
        d_T(A,B)=|2-(-2)|+|4-1|=7
      </me>.
      You can see now why this geometry is called taxicab geometry. More importantly, if we call the path between the points <m> A=(-1,1) </m> and <m> B=(2,4) </m> that is used to determine the taxicab distance the <term> taxicab path </term> then you can also see that the taxicab path between <m> A=(-1,1) </m> and <m> B=(2,4) </m> is not unique.
