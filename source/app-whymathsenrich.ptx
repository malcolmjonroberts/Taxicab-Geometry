  <title>My Approach To Mathematics Enrichment</title>

  <introduction>
  <p> What is mathematics enrichment, who is it for, what does it aim to achieve, is it worthwhile? Such questions, I think, are worth thinking about for anyone involved in putting together a mathematics enrichment program. Indeed, there is a growing academic research literature devoted to probing such questions. See for example "references". What this literature shows, I feel, is that these questions, like any questions concerning human activity and motivation, are subtly nuanced, multi-faceted and surprisingly complex. So, in the following paragraphs I will briefly describe the format of the mathematical enrichment sessions for senior mathematics students that I put together and then briefy discuss how the structure and operation of those sessions was informed by my views on the above questions. Let me be upfront and say that, while I did plenty of thinking about the issues related to these questions, I never did any form of structured research in an effort to get a more complete answer to any of them. So the following discussion is, at best, just an opinion piece.

  <section xml:id="sec-structure">
    <title>Structure Of The Mathematics Enrichment Program</title>

    <p> When I was in charge of the mathematics outreach (as we called it) at the University of Newcastle, we ran three mathematics enrichment programs, one aimed at Years 7, 8 students (i.e. junior high school), one aimed at Year 9 and 10 students (i.e. middle high school) and one aimed at Year 11 students, (i.e. senior high school). We called this the University of Newcastle Young Mathematicians Program, (UoNYMP). In the junior high school program the sessions were based on topics that students don't get to see in the standard school curricululm. In the middle high school program the sessions were based on the idea of thinking and working mathematically. In the senior high program we covered just one topic outside of the school curriculum but we looked at the topic in depth. The topic was, of course, taxicab geometry. Figure ? shows the front page of a small flyer that we used to promote our outreach. We were somewhat flexible in letting students attend whichever program they wanted. A number of students, having already attended one program, would come back the next year to attend the next program up even though they weren't in the target years. Other students attended a program up just so that they could be with friends. (Rarely did students attend a program for those younger than their years!). 
    </p>

    <p> The senior high school program had six 2-hour face-to-face sessions run at the University's Newcastle campus (from 4pm to 6pm) every second week over the course of one school term (i.e 12 weeks). Invitations were sent to all high schools within the region and the schools responded if they had students that wanted to attend. The sessions were free but we had a limit of 40 students. So, the students had to not only be sufficiently interested to self select (or to say yes when encouraged by their teachers) but also had to have the ability to not only get to the University but to get to there at the designated time. Not surprisingly then, I feel, we never had the problem of having to turn students away! On the other hand, we also never had the problem of not having enough students attend that we felt that the effort was not worth it. Teachers were also welcome to attend.
    </p>

    <p> Within the sessions themselves, the structure was usually a mixture of a presenter talking, students working together in groups and whole-class discussions. As mentioned above, we used taxicab geometry as the topic for all six sessions but, apart from the first session, each session was independent. The sessions were somewhat informal in that attendance wasn't policed, although we did keep track of numbers for program review purposes. We also had a web presence where students could obtain materials if they missed a session. We also tried to encourage the students to write up some of their own investigations for "publication" on the website but, invariably, this was never taken up. The students, it seemed, had too many other activities/pressures that took precedence.

    <title> What Is Mathematics Enrichment? </title>

    <p> I think that it is reasonable to say that the term "mathematics enrichment" is usually associated with any program that operates outside of, and in addition to, the formal classroom. Even within this view the term mathematics enrichment covers a wide variety of programs. For example, the program may be one that provides an avenue for acceleration through the standard curriculum. Alternatively, the program may be one that provides exposure to topics not otherwise covered in the curriculum. Then, within the program itself, the focus might be on the content per se, or it might be more on skills and attitudes. In this view, mathematics enrichment is about providing additional opportunities to stimulate, encourage and develop the more mathematically able student.
    </p>

    <p> An insight into the range of thinking about what is enrichment in general see for example Renzulli & Reis (2014) and what is mathematics enrichment in particular, see Piggott (2011). Piggott argues that mathematics enrichment should be aimed at all students and not just those identified within the formal classroom as more mathematically able. Renzulli & Reis advocate that the foundations for enrichment should be laid within the classroom and that within this foundation an explicit path for further opportunities is made clear to the students. That is, for Renzulli & Reis enrichment should be planned for within the classroom but pursued beyond the standard classroom. For Piggott, mathematics enrichment is about providing opportunities for students to engage in "doing mathematics" and hence develop skills in the processes of problem solving and mathematical thinking. For both of these authors, mathematics enrichment requires a focus on the teaching as well as the content. This view of mathematics enrichment (which I will call the "embedded view" is very different to the first view, outlined in the previous paragraph (which I will call the "add-on view").
    </p>

    <p> My own view on mathematics enrichment is definitely more toward the embedded end of the spectrum than the simple add-on end. However, given the practical constraints of working within state and national education systems the UoNYMP mathematical enrichment program was set up to provide opportunities to engage with mathematics that is not available within the formal classroom, that is as purely an add-on progam. However, given that I feel that most students experience of mathematics from the formal classroom (in NSW at least) is mostly that of working through tasks set by others with a fair idea of which techniques to use, having students engage with problem solving, mathematical thinking and the creative side of mathematics is definitely a possible focus of mathematics enrichment. While our middle high school mathematics enrichment program had an explicit focus on problem solving and mathematical thinking, the senior high school program had more of a focus on doing, and engaging with, mathematics. I hasten to point out that I haven't explained in any detail what I am thinking when I say "doing, and engaging with, mathematics" and, further, that it is very likely that it will be different to what those terms might mean to the reader. Nonetheless, I feel that in having this focus, UoNYMP was trying to align more with the embedded view of mathematics enrichment.
    </p>

    <p> As an aside, Renzulli & Reis put forward what they called the Triad model of enrichment. In this model a large pool of students engage in Type I enrichment activities. These activities are aimed at exposing students to a wide range of ideas and contexts. From there students access Type II activities that are aimed at giving students the skills they need to be independent learners so that they could further pursue any of those ideas and contexts that appealed to them from the Type I activities. To complete the Triad, Type III activities are those where the students start to think and behave like practitioners in the field of interest. Renzulli and Reis believe that these type of activities can only be done with very small groups. I'd like to think that the full UoNYMP structure, to some extent, followed the Triad model even though it was at a very small scale, not at all as coherent and did not have the rigour in getting to know students strengths and interests as Renzulli and Reis advocate.

    <title> Who Is It For And What Does It Aim To Achieve? </title>

    <p> I believe that the conventional view of mathematics enrichment is that is for the mathematically more able students, usually measured by results in formal mathematics classes. Why would those who are not strong at mathematics want to participate in yet more mathematical activities, right? The aim of the enrichment, then,would be to try to develop the passion for mathematics within these students by providing stimulating and challenging mathematical activities in an environment of like minded people. As mentioned above, Piggott (2011) argues that enrichment should be available to all students. In this case the aim of the enrichment activities is to develop transferable skills (such as problem solving and critical thinking) that would be benficial to all students. Renzulli and Reis (2014) talk about gifted and talented behaviours of students rather than just gifted and talented students. While there is often a large overlap between the cohort of students the two viewpoints will identify, using behaviours as a key results in students themselves being more involved in the identification process.
    </p>

    <p> My own view, enrichment to those interested (rather than those regarded as able). Provided within an enabling environment. Concentrating on attitudes to mathematics (including doing mathematics).
    </p>

    <p> UoNYMP definitely was accessed by the mathematically able. Cause and effect with passion and performance?
    </p>

    <p> The University has its own agenda: future enrollments and image, Students might have a different view. What about Parents? What were UoNYMP's view?

    <title> Is Mathematical Enrichment Worthwhile? </title>

    <p>

  </section>

  <p> Let's now return to the questions posed above, (what is mathematics enrichment, who is it for, what does it aim to achieve, is it worthwhile?) Note that I have to talk in the past tense here because it has been some years since I was involved with the University and its mathematics enrichment programs. Firstly then, why did the University run a mathematics enrichment program? Actually, it would be more correct to say that the University supported the mathematics enrichment program because it ran because someone (me) was prepared to run it. While the reasons why the University was prepared to support the progam were never explicitly articulated anywhere, I felt that there were two main driving factors. Firstly, the University felt that the enrichment program was a way to have students establish a connection with the University and so increase the liklihood of them choosing to study at the University. Secondly, the University also felt that running an enrichment program reflected well on the University in terms of contributing to its the local community. An interesting side effect of the University's viewpoint is that they felt that the bigger (in terms of numbers of students reached) the program, and the more high profile it was, the better. A program that went statewide, or nationally, was far more desirable to one that only aimed to reach 40 or so students. I deliberately didn't want to expand the mathematics enrichment program, though. I much preferred to get to know the students and to work with them over an extended period of time.
  </p>

  <p> Next, why did the students want to attend the mathematics enrichment program? I must admit to not doing any formal surveys to try to answer this question and so I only have my own opinions based on my interaction with the students.
