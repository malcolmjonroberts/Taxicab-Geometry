  <title>My Approach To Mathematics Enrichment</title>

  <p> What is mathematics enrichment, who is it for, what does it aim to achieve, is it worthwhile? Such questions, I think, are worth thinking about for anyone involved in putting together a mathematics enrichment program. Indeed, there is a growing academic research literature devoted to probing such questions. See for example "references". What this literature shows, I feel, is that these questions, like any questions concerning human activity and motivation, are subtly nuanced, multi-faceted and surprisingly complex. So, in the following paragraphs I will briefly describe the format of the mathematical enrichment sessions for senior mathematics students that I put together and then briefy discuss how the structure and operation of those sessions was informed by my views on the above questions. Hopefully this will give some context and insight into to the contents of this book.

  <p> When I was in charge of the mathematics outreach program at the University of Newcastle, we ran two mathematics enrichment programs, one aimed at Years 7, 8 and 9 students (i.e. junior high school) and one aimed at Years 10, 11 and 12 students, (i.e. senior high school). The senior high school program had six 2-hour face-to-face sessions run at the University's Newcastle campus (from 4pm to 6pm) every second week over the course of one school term (i.e 12 weeks). Invitations were sent to all high schools within the region and the schools responded if they had students that wanted to attend. The sessions were free but we had a limit of 40 students. Teachers were also welcome to attend. So, the students had to not only be sufficiently interested to self select (or to say yes when encouraged by their teachers) but also had to have the ability to not only get to the University but to get to there at the designated time. Not surprisingly then, I feel, we never had the problem of having to turn students away!

  <p> Within the sessions themselves, the structure was usually a mixture of me talking, students working together in groups and whole-class discussions. We used taxicab geometry as the topic for all six sessions but, apart from the first session, each session was independent. The sessions were somewhat informal in that attendance wasn't policed, although we did keep numbers for program review purposes. We also had a web presence where students could obtain materials if they missed a session. We also tried to encourage the students to write up some of their own investigations for "publication" on the website but, invariably, this was never taken up. The students, it seemed, had too many other activities/pressures that took precedence.

  <p> Let's now return to the questions posed above, (what is mathematics enrichment, who is it for, what does it aim to achieve, is it worthwhile?) Note that I have to talk in the past tense here because it has been some years since I was involved with the University and its mathematics enrichment programs. So, why did the University run a mathematics enrichment program? Actually, it would be more correct to say that the University supported the mathematics enrichment program because it ran because someone (me) was prepared to run it. While the reasons why the University was prepared to support the progam were never explicitly articulated anywhere, I felt that there were two main driving factors. Firstly, the University felt that the enrichment program was a way to have students establish a connection with the University and so increase the liklihood of them choosing to study at the University. Secondly, the University also felt that running an enrichment program reflected well on the University in terms of contributing to its the local community. An interesting side effect of the University's viewpoint is that they felt that the bigger (in terms of numbers of students reached) the program, and the more high profile it was, the better. A program that went statewide, or nationally, was far more desirable to one that only aimed to reach 40 or so students. I deliberately didn't want to expand the mathematics enrichment program, though. I much preferred to get to know the students and to work with them over an extended period of time.
