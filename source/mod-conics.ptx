		<subsection> <title> The Conics in Euclidean Geometry </title>

    		<p> In Euclidean geometry the <term> conics </term> are a family of curves in the plane. They can
				be defined in a number of different ways.
    		</p>

    		<definition> <title> A Geometric Definition </title>
				<p> A conic section (or simply conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of a plane and the
					surface of a cone (or two cones placed apex to apex). The four types
					of (non-degenerate) conics are the hyperbola, the parabola, the ellipse and the
					circle. See figure ?.
				</p>
			</definition>

			<definition> <title> An Algebraic Definition </title>
				<p> A conic section is a curve associated with the equation
					<me> Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+dx+Ey+F=0 </me>
				where <m> A, B, C, D, E, F </m> are real numbers and <m> A </m>, <m> B </m> and <m> C </m> are not all 0.
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p> If <m> B-4AC /lt 0 </m> then the equation represents an ellipse, a circle, a point or no curve. For the equation to represent a circle <m> A=C </m> and <m> B=0 </m>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> If <m> B-4AC=0 </m> then the equation represents an parabola, two parallel lines, one line or no curve. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> If <m> B-4AC/gt 0 </m> then the equation represents a hyperbola or two intersecting lines. If also <m> A+C= 0 </m> then the equation represents a rectangular hyperbola.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</definition>

			<definition> <title> A Focus-Directrix Definition </title>
				<p> A conic section is a curve associated with the equation </p>
				<p> where A, B, C, D, E, F are real numbers and A, B and C are not all 0.
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p> If B-4AC0 then the equation represents an ellipse, a circle, a point or no curve. For the equation to represent a circle A=C and B=0.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> If B-4AC=0 then the equation represents an parabola, two parallel lines, one line or no curve. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> If B-4AC0 then the equation represents a hyperbola or two intersecting lines. If also A+C=0 then the equation represents a rectangular hyperbola.
							</p>
						</li>

			<definition> <title> A Locus Definition </title>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p> A circle is the locus of a point <m> P </m> that moves such that its distance from a given point <m> C </m> remains constant, <ie /> such that
								<me> d(P,C)=r. </me>. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> A parabola is lthe locus of a point P that moves such that its distance from a given point F and a given line l remains equal, <ie /> such that 
								<me> d(P,F)=d(P,l) </me>. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> An ellipse is the locus of a point <m> P </m> that moves such that the sum of its distances from two given points <m> F_1 </m> and <m> F_2 </m> remains equal, <ie /> such that
								<me> d(P,F_1)+d(P,F_2)=k </me>. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> A hyperbola is the locus of a point <m> P  </m> that moves such that the difference of its distances from two given points <m> F_1 </m> and <m> F_2 </m> remains constant, <ie /> such that
								<me> d(P,F_1)-d(P,F_2)=k </me>. </p>
						</li>
