		<subsection> <title> The Conics in Euclidean Geometry </title>

    		<p>
				In Euclidean geometry the <term> conics </term> are a family of curves in the plane. They can be defined in a number of different ways.
    		</p>

    		<definition> <title> A Geometric Definition </title>
				<p> 
					A <term> conic </term>) is a curve obtained as the intersection of a plane and the surface of a cone (or two cones placed apex to apex). The four types of (non-degenerate) conics are the hyperbola, the parabola, the ellipse and the circle, as illustrated in figure ?
				</p>
			</definition>

			<p>
				From figure ? you can why a this family of curves is also sometimes referred to as the conic sections, (rather than simply the conics).
			</p>

			<definition> <title> An Algebraic Definition </title>
				<p> A <term> conic </term> is a curve associated with the equation
					<me> Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+dx+Ey+F=0 </me>
				where <m> A, B, C, D, E, F </m> are real numbers and <m> A </m>, <m> B </m> and <m> C </m> are not all 0.
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p> If <m> B-4AC /lt 0 </m> then the equation represents an ellipse, a circle, a point or no curve. For the equation to represent a circle <m> A=C </m> and <m> B=0 </m>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> If <m> B-4AC = 0 </m> then the equation represents an parabola, two parallel lines, one line or no curve. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> If <m> B-4AC /gt 0 </m> then the equation represents a hyperbola or two intersecting lines. If also <m> A+C= 0 </m> then the equation represents a rectangular hyperbola.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

			<p> Add a couple of examples here. </p>

			<definition> <title> A Focus-Directrix Definition </title>
				<p> A non-circular <term> conic </term> is the set of points, <m> P </m>, whose distances to a given point <m> F </m>, called the focus, and a given line <m> l </m>, called the directrix, are in a fixed ration, <m> e </m>, called the eccentricity, <ie /> for which
					<me> /frac{d(P,F)}{d(P,l)} = e </me>.
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p> If <m> e /lt 1 </m> then the conic is an ellipse. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> If <m> e = 1 </m> then the conice is a parabola. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> If <m> e /gt 1 </m> then the conic is a hyperbola. </p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</definition>

			<p> Add a couple of examples here too. </p>

			<definition> <title> A Locus Definition </title>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p> A circle is the locus of a point <m> P </m> that moves such that its distance from a given point <m> C </m> remains constant, <ie /> such that
								<me> d(P,C)=r. </me>. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> A parabola is lthe locus of a point P that moves such that its distance from a given point F and a given line l remains equal, <ie /> such that 
								<me> d(P,F)=d(P,l) </me>. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> An ellipse is the locus of a point <m> P </m> that moves such that the sum of its distances from two given points <m> F_1 </m> and <m> F_2 </m> remains equal, <ie /> such that
								<me> d(P,F_1)+d(P,F_2)=k </me>. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> A hyperbola is the locus of a point <m> P  </m> that moves such that the difference of its distances from two given points <m> F_1 </m> and <m> F_2 </m> remains constant, <ie /> such that
								<me> d(P,F_1)-d(P,F_2)=k </me>. </p>
						</li>
					</ol>
